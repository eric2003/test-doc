Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the mathematics and continuum mechanics literature (cf. Marsden and Hughes, 1983),
different symbols are often used for the same field when it is expressed in terms of different
independent variables, that is, when the description is Eulerian or Lagrangian. In this
convention, the function which in an Eulerian description is :math:`f(\mathbf{x},t)` is denoted by :math:`F(\mathbf{X},t)` in a
Lagrangian description. The two functions are related by
