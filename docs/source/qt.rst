Qt
==================================

Qt is a cross-platform application development framework that allows developers to create high-performance, scalable, and portable applications. It provides a set of libraries and tools for various aspects such as GUI, networking, and databases. Qt also has an easy-to-use integrated development environment (IDE) called Qt Creator, which helps developers to develop and debug Qt applications more quickly.
